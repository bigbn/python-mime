python-mime - A proper MIME type library for Python

python-mime implements platform-specific MIME parsing. So far, only the xdg implementation is fully supported.
There is a minimal windows (winreg-based) implementation.

Usage:
>>> import mime
>>> m = mime.MimeType("image/jpeg")
>>> m.comment()
u'JPEG image'
>>> m.aliases()
[u'image/pjpeg']

It is possible to query MIME types by file name (name-based matching)

>>> mime.MimeType.fromName('myfile.png')
<MimeType: image/png>

It is also possible to query it by file content with MimeType.fromContent, although this is not fully implemented.

XDG-based MIME types support MIME Actions.

>>> m.associations()
['qiviewer.desktop', 'firefox.desktop', 'wine-extension-jfif.desktop', 'wine-extension-jpe.desktop']

It is also possible to query the default application associated with a MIME type with defaultApplication().
There is not always a default application associated with a MIME type. In order to get the most appropriate application
to open a MIME type with, do:

>>> mime.MimeType.fromName("file.html").bestApplication()
'google-chrome.desktop'
